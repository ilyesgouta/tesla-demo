how to compile tesla demo:

1) create "Project" in your main directory on any hard disk

2) uncompress tesla_src.zip into "Project" directory

3) start vc6.0 with \Project\Demo\Demo.dsw

4) you will need some additional libraries to link the exe file:

- zlib.lib ( http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/zlib/ )
- pnglib.lib ( http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/ )
- jpeglib.lib ( http://www.ijg.org/ )
- bass sound system ( http://www.un4seen.com/music/ )

5) compile additional libraries and link with demo project
   probably you will have to change smasher/link settings, and maybe ImageLib sources 

6) have fun...
