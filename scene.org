          How can you help?

          * You can help by donating money to scene.org. All money will go
            into upgrading the archive, and will allow us to improve our
            services to you and the rest of the scene.

          * We are also looking for corporate sponsors. The return on a
            sponsorship involves advertising the company on the archive. This
            is an ideal method for a company to reach a global potential
            customer base of young, talented and motivated people in the
            computer and design business.

          * Thirdly, we are looking for mirrors for our archive. Mirrors help
            us with lowering the demand on our main server and improve the
            availability of the archive around the world.

            For more info mail to staff@scene.org. If you feel ready to donate
            money, look at the instructions at http://www.scene.org/bank.html
